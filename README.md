portfolio
=========

This will be the construction of my portfolio website. 

Deciding whether or not to implement my own javascript contact form or usng a pre-made one from Google Forms is a difficult choice. 

Finally finished the construction of this portfolio site which begins my web career. We shall see how things go from here. I will be looking toward implementing a blog which I build from RoR and more than likely going to implement a Skills page to showcase what I'm good at and what I'm not so good at. 

Contact
=========

Update 1: Implemented the Google Forms to the webpage but having issues with the CSS rules for the page itself. Gotta shift it to the form to the right. Will figure out how to do so by the second update. 

Update 2: Successfully implemented the Google Forms into this page as well as fixed the CSS rules which really boiled down to the div tags not being properly implemented. 

Building my own Form 
=========

Pros
---------
1) I get to learn how to build a form using javascript 
2) I learn more about how Javascript works and how to implement it with a database 
3) I would be able to have complete control over my form 

Cons
---------
1) The form is already premade and will sync to my Google Drive 
2) I would easily be able to see peoples responses via Google Sheets 
3) It would be simpler to implement. 

I think at the end of the day I will go with Google Forms for the time being just because why re-invent the wheel. Right? 

Perhaps another time I will focus on implementing a javascript form for another project but for this one it will be simpiler to just build one from Google Forms.
